## About me:

Angular Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience in various team settings (remote and on-site).

I contribute to the full development cycle—from requirements to deployment—building scalable, high-performance applications with modern architecture, automated testing, and CI/CD. Proficient in NgRx for state management and using Nx for large project optimization. Experienced in implementing real-time features (WebSockets) and migrating Angular apps to the latest versions to apply best practices.

I also have experience on the backend: developing simple microservices with Node.js, building APIs using Fastify/Express, and working with SQL/NoSQL databases. I apply architectural concepts like DDD and MVC. I'm dedicated to performance optimization and happy to mentor and participate in code reviews.
